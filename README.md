This project for L&S 88 attempts to recreate the analysis by Walt Hickey in his article _41 Percent Of Fliers Think You're Rude If You Recline Your Seat_ which analyzes a survey data set from SurveyMonkey. The purpose of this project is to attempt to reproduce the findings in the original analysis regarding what the public regards as proper plane etiquette. We will also evaluate the efficacy and reliability of this data set to qualify any conclusions that we draw. For more detailed information, see our [Pre-Analysis Plan](notebooks/pre-analysis-plan.ipynb).
